# chrome-a11y-caret-browsing-extension

This is an unofficial snapshot of the [Chrome Accessibility Project's Extension for Caret
Browsing](https://chrome.google.com/webstore/detail/caret-browsing/fklpgenihifpccgiifchnihilipmbffg). It is
provided as a convenience for those who are interested in how this functionality—to get a caret within any
text on a webpage and being able to navigate and to highlight text ranges with the cursor keys—has been
implemented.
